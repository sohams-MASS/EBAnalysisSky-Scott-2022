Navigation of Files:

1. **GeneralDay.m** operates on nd2 images directly existing in a directory. It scans the directory for all nd2 images, and analyses the images based on the settings provided. 

	Relevant Helper Functions: nd2info.m and nd2read.m (Citation: Chao-Yen Yuhâ€™s nd2read (https://github.com/joe-of-all-trades/nd2read))

	**Note: For best results with computation time and accuracy, it is best to use an image that its not too dense with EBs**

	This is extremely dense of an image - the image can be segmented, but computation times skyrocket: 

	<img src='Development_Scripts/Dense_2.png' width='300'><img src='Development_Scripts/Dense.png' width='300'>

	Pipeline of GeneralDay.m with an ideal example image. 

	First it converts the nd2 image to a color and black and white png images: 

	<img src='Development_Scripts/pngimage.png' width='300'><img src='Development_Scripts/bwimage.png' width='300'>

	Second it segments the bw image (red circles denote found EBs using the current settings (range and sensitivity) and scan number)
		
	<img src='Development_Scripts/segmentedbw.png' width='300'>

	Finally, it will calculate the circularity scores and the boundary color of the EBs denote the circularity score for both bw and color - heatmap is provided to the side of the image. 
		
	<img src='Development_Scripts/colormappedbw.png' width='300'> <img src='Development_Scripts/colormappedcolor.png' width='300'>

	Rescan with different settings to capture other remaining EBs, as necessary. 

	Relevant Function Details are provided in the file description but also reproduced here: 

	Reproduced here for clarity:
	```
	function GeneralDay(LL, range, sensitivity)
	%%%LL responds to which scan your doing of the files (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
	%%%Range is the sizes of EBs that you are searching for in pixel diameters - is a 2x1 vector with
	%%%[smallest_diameter largest_diameter];
	%%%Sensitivity (0-1) s a hyperparameter for choosing for which EB to select for
	%%%(higher sensitivities are needed for bigger EBs)
	%%% Recommendations for Range and Sensitivity

	%Start with [20 200], 0.72
	%Then with [40 200] 0.76
	%Then with [60 200] 0.80
	%Then [80 200] 0.88
	%Then with [90 200] with 0.92

	%Naming Conventions is based on the File Name given. 

	%Function will show analysis of images as they happen. 
	%Key outputs 
	%1. BW Image [Image Name will be appended with BW.png]
	%2. Color Image [Image Name will be appended with color.png]
	%3. Segmented BW Image [Image Name will be appended with clean.png]
	%4. Segmented BW Image with Circularity Map [Image Name will be appended with colormappedBW.png]
	%5. Segmented Color Image with Circularity Bars [Image Name will be appended with colormapped.png]
	%6. Text file with the following format of the columns of the numbers of
	%identified EBs
	%[Center_x Center_y Diameter Circularity]
	%7. Function will ask you which Day and Run (N) you are analysing - and use
	%these to output a text file with all EB diameters and circularity scores.
	%The diameter text file will have name of (Run)_(Day).txt.
	%The circularity text file will have name of (Run)_(Day)circle.txt.
	%Function will remove any repeats as necessary per increasing scan of
	%image. 

	```

2. **ViolinPlotter.m** operates on text files generated from GeneralDay to plot ViolinPlots - based on  2016, Bastian Bechtold Violin.m code. Violin Plotter Generates violin plots of data of both circularity and diameter of EBs. 

	Relevant Helper Functions Violin.m and violinplot.m (Citation: Bechtold, Bastian, 2016. https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4559847)
	<img src='Development_Scripts/N56.1 Circularity Ratio.png' width='300'><img src='Development_Scripts/N56.1 Diameter Sizes.png' width='300'>

3. **Development_Scripts** contain scripts and images that were used during development of above code. It is not recommended to use these scripts, but placed here for full clarity and development.
